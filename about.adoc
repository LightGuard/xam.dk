== Danish guy enjoying working on open source software.

Making things happen at Red Hat. 

I currently work as technical lead of http://tools.jboss.org[JBoss Tools] and http://devstudio.redhat.com[JBoss Developer Studio]. 

I co-host http://asylum.jboss.org[JBoss Asylum] podcast.

I'm on the http://eclipse.org[Eclipse board]. 

Have been spotted running at agility competitions and
twittering too much about email clients!
